        <h1>Hi, I'm Sydney!</h1>

        <div class="bordered-text">
       <p>Sydney is a third-year Visual Communications student at San Francisco State University, having transferred from Chabot College in Hayward. She currently resides in San Leandro and has spent her whole life in the Bay Area, which has significantly shaped her personal and creative growth. Her older sister, also a creative, has been a major role model, encouraging Sydney to explore new experiences, including trying different foods and visiting new places. This push to explore outside her comfort zone has helped Sydney recognize the importance of curiosity and growth, fueling her goals.</p>
            <br>
    
       <p>Sydney is focused on expanding her knowledge in graphic design and interactive design as part of her major. With a strong interest in creativity and technology, she is always seeking opportunities to learn beyond the classroom. Over the course of her studies, Sydney has worked on typography design, digital art illustration, and has created a magazine based on an environmental research study. These projects have helped her pursue a larger interest in design. Additionally, she learns and connects with other designers on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, which help her creative process.</p>
            <br>
        
       <p>As a creative individual, Sydney is passionate about exploring various aspects of visual communication, particularly through web design and packaging. She has a specific interest in book design and game design and aspires to work for a publishing company in the future, where she can blend her love for reading and digital media.</p>
            <br>

       <p>Outside of her studies, Sydney finds inspiration in her hobbies, which include gaming, reading, visiting bookstores (both old and new), and walking around the city. She also enjoys trying new food, watching shows, hanging out with friends and family, and hiking with her three dogs whenever she has the chance. This blend of personal interests and creative pursuits continually shapes her approach to design and drives her to find new ways to express her ideas.</p>
