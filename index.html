        <h1>Hi, I'm Sydney!</h1>

        <p class="bordered-text">
        Sydney is a Visual Communications student at San Francisco State University, originally from San Leandro
        in the East Bay. Growing up in the Bay Area has greatly influenced and shaped her as a person. Currently,
        Sydney is focused on expanding her expertise in both UI/UX and graphic design as part of her program.
        With a strong interest in creativity and technology, she is always looking for ways to deepen
        her skills and knowledge.
        <br>
        <br>
        Her passion lies in exploring visual communication through web design and packaging. She
        enjoys book packaging specifically, and her goal is to be a part of book designing in the future. Outside the classroom, 
        
        Sydney has a variety of hobbies that keep her inspired. She enjoys playing and analyzing PC video games, where she 
        examines the visual design and user experience in open world games. Reading epic fantasy is another significant part of her life, 
        fueling her imagination and helping her think creatively. And most of all, she loves hiking with her three dogs.</p>
